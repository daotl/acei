# ACEI Spec

This is a markdown specification of the ACEI protocol.
[ACEI](./acei/README.md) defines the interactions between the
application and consensus engine over ACEI.

If you find discrepancies between the spec and the code that
do not have an associated issue or pull request on github,
please submit an [issue](https://github.com/daotl/acei/issues)!
